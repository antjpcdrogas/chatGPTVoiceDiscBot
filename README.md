- The original version was using an unoffical API: [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/) by [transitive-bullshit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit). I no longer use it but was useful to understand how openai module works. Thanks!
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com) for providing [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)
